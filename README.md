# MSW-API Bleeding
This repository houses the latest (bleeding edge) version of [MSW-API](https://github.com/duncpro/MSW-API). While the goal
when submitting pull requests is that the code will be bug free and 100% 
functional, it is not guaranteed that binaries built from this repository 
will work as expected. Furthermore this repository represents the next
full release of [MSW-API](https://github.com/duncpro/MSW-API) in its unfinished state. This code is highly
volatile and subject to frequent change. Because of this it is recommended
that you do not build plugins against these binaries.

## Documentation

automatically regenerated and pushed to https://duncpro.github.io/MSW-API-Bleeding/apidocs.

## Binaries
You can find up-to-date binaries for this repository at https://github.com/duncpro/MSW-API-Bleeding/releases.
You are strongly advised NOT to build plugins against these binaries
as they represents the next version of MSW-API in its unfinished state.
